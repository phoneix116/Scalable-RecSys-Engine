## 📋 Overview

This project is a movie recommendation system that suggests movies based on user preferences, movie similarity, and genre preferences. The system uses content-based filtering and clustering techniques to provide personalized recommendations from a dataset of over 25 million movie entries.

## ✨ Features

- **Search Functionality**: Search movies by title or partial title match
- **Genre-Based Search**: Browse movies by specific genres
- **Content-Based Recommendations**: Get movies similar to ones you like based on genres and features
- **Cluster-Based Recommendations**: Alternative recommendation method using KMeans clustering
- **Caching System**: Improved performance with cached results for repeat searches
- **Responsive Web Interface**: Clean and user-friendly web interface
- **Performance Optimizations**: Efficient algorithms to handle large datasets
- **Activity Logging**: Comprehensive logging for monitoring and debugging

## 🔄 Recent Updates

### Performance Optimizations (v1.2.0)
- **Enhanced Persistent Caching**: 
  - Added dedicated `cache/` directory for persistent cache files
  - Implemented shelve-based persistent caching for recommendations and genre queries
  - Added JSON fallback for cache entries when shelve operations fail
  - Cache now survives server restarts with improved data persistence
- **Fast Lookup Indices**: Implemented multi-tier search with specialized indices for titles, titles without years, and word matching
- **Batch Processing**: Added batch processing for index building to reduce memory usage with large datasets
- **Annoy Integration**: Added approximate nearest-neighbor search with lazy loading and timeout protection

### Bug Fixes
- **Regex Error Handling**: Fixed "bad character range" errors in genre regex by properly escaping special characters
- **Variable Scope**: Resolved "local variable referenced before assignment" issues in recommendation logic
- **Cache Directory Management**: Added automatic creation of cache directories with proper permissions
- **Error Recovery**: Improved error handling with detailed logging and graceful fallbacks

### Feature Flags
- **ENABLE_ANNOY**: Toggle expensive Annoy-based recommendation features
- **ENABLE_CONTENT_BASED**: Control content-based recommendation algorithms
  - Useful to disable on systems with limited memory (< 16GB)
  - System will automatically fall back to cluster-based recommendations on memory errors
- **FAST_STARTUP**: Run in development mode with `--fast` flag to load only a subset of data

### Search Improvements
- **Multi-Strategy Search**: Enhanced title matching with hierarchical fallback strategies
- **Smart Caching**: Improved in-memory and persistent caching for recommendations and genre searches
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Graceful degradation with timeout protection and multiple fallback methods

### API Enhancements
- **CORS Support**: Added proper cross-origin resource sharing support
- **JSONP Support**: Added JSONP response wrapping via a decorator
- **Enhanced Error Handling**: Comprehensive error recovery with detailed logging

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

### Backend
- **Python 3.10**: Core programming language
- **Flask**: Web server framework
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis
- **NumPy**: Numerical computations
- **scikit-learn**: Machine learning algorithms for clustering and recommendations
- **Flask-CORS**: Cross-Origin Resource Sharing support

### Frontend
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: Frontend development
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices

## 📊 Dataset

The system uses three main datasets:
- `df.csv` (~3GB): Main dataset with movie information and pre-computed features
- `movies.csv` (~3MB): Basic movie information
- `ratings.csv` (~678MB): User ratings data

## 🚀 Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10 or higher
- Sufficient RAM (16GB+ recommended for optimal performance)
  - For smaller systems, use the `--fast` flag to reduce memory requirements
  - System will automatically fall back to less memory-intensive algorithms if needed
- Git

### Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Deepanshu-Pahwa/Movie-Reccomendation-Website-With-K-Means.git
cd Movie-Reccomendation-Website-With-K-Means
```

### Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run the Application
```bash
python backend_df_direct_fixed.py
```

For faster startup during development (loads a smaller dataset subset):
```bash
python backend_df_direct_fixed.py --fast
```

The application will be available at http://localhost:3000

> **Note:** On first run, the system will process the dataset and build necessary indices, which may take some time. Cache files will be automatically generated to speed up subsequent startups.

## 📝 Usage

1. **Home Page**: Enter a movie title in the search box or browse by genre
2. **Search Results**: View matching movies and select one for recommendations
3. **Recommendation Page**: Get personalized movie recommendations based on your selection
4. **Discover**: Explore popular movies and trending genres

## 🔍 API Endpoints

- `/search`: Search for movies by title or get recommendations
- `/recommend`: Get movie recommendations based on a title (with persistent caching)
- `/movies-by-genre`: Get movies filtered by genre (with persistent caching)
- `/movie-details`: Get detailed information about a movie
- `/api-status`: Check API status
- `/clear-cache`: Clear the in-memory recommendation cache
- `/clear-persistent-caches`: Clear all persistent cache files (shelve and JSON)

## ⚙️ Performance Considerations

- **Multi-level Caching System**:
  - Memory caching for fast, frequent queries
  - Persistent disk-based caching (shelve) for recommendations and genre queries
  - JSON backup files for cache data redundancy
  - Automatic cache directory creation and management
- Timeout mechanisms prevent long-running operations
- Vectorized operations and efficient filtering for large dataset handling
- Boolean indexing and sampling techniques for improved performance
- Regex optimization with proper escape handling for special characters
- **Memory Management**:
  - Graceful fallbacks when memory-intensive operations fail
  - Automatic switch to cluster-based recommendations if content-based filtering exceeds memory limits
  - Memory error handling for large matrix operations (especially with 25M+ rows)
  - Configurable via feature flags to adapt to available system resources

## 🔒 Caching Architecture

The system implements a sophisticated caching strategy:

1. **In-memory Caching**: Fastest access for recent queries
2. **Persistent Caching**:
   - Uses Python's `shelve` module for dictionary-like persistent storage
   - Maintains separate files for genre and recommendation caches
   - Creates JSON backups for each cache entry as fallback
   - Cache files persist across server restarts
3. **Cache Management**:
   - Clear in-memory cache via `/clear-cache` endpoint
   - Clear persistent caches via `/clear-persistent-caches` endpoint
   - Automatic cache validation and error recovery

> **Note:** Cache files (`df_cache.pkl` and `indices_cache.pkl`) will be generated automatically when you run the application for the first time. Additionally, persistent cache files for recommendations and genres will be created in the `cache/` directory. These files significantly improve startup time and query performance on subsequent runs and should not be committed to version control.
